Creating ADT Data Strcutures In Python

singlyLinkedList.py : 

This program creates a singly linked list and also has a menu to modify that list with seven options: 
1) Add Element (Tail Position)
2) Add Element (Positioned)   
3) Add Header
4) Delete Header
5) Delete Element (Positioned)
6) Get Data (Positioned)      
7) Change Data (Positioned) 

With every option chosen, the list gets updated and diplays its content, along with its current length.

list_merger.py :

This program creates two dummy unordered linked lists and then merges them to create a ordered merged linked list while taking new inputs from the menu into the dummy list one or two and continuously updating both the unordered lists and the ordered merged list.
