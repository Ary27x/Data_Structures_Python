Creating ADT Data Strcutures In Python

singlyLinkedList.py : 

This program creates a singly linked list and also has a menu to modify that list with seven options: 
1) Add Element
2) Add Element (Positioned)   
3) Add Header
4) Delete Header
5) Delete Element (Positioned)
6) Get Data (Positioned)      
7) Change Data (Positioned) 

With every option chosen, the list gets updated and diplays its content, along with its current length.
